    </div>
    <div class="col-md-12 text-justified">
      <p>We are an all-woman software development team dedicated to fixing the broken American welfare system that leaves vulnerable people without access to available public assistance. We created mRelief.com and have reduced wait times in Chicago by 75 percent.  At this blog, we share what we are learning about how technology, especially open government, can work to the benefit of the public and help forge the path of least resistance to economic mobility. Our users are innovative government personnel, bold case workers, and  brave working Americans who remain persistent interacting with the safety net of healthcare, food, housing, childcare, cash -- all for the public benefit.</p>

      <h3>Productivity Apps We Love</h3>
      <p><i>By Rose Afriyie, Published September 18th, 2015</i></p>
      
      <p>It is hard out here for an entrepreneur. So many tasks, so little time — but luckily, so much technology to help. Our team has a knack for saving time. After all, we spend most of our days and hours helping governments and caseworkers figure out how to streamline their social service delivery process so that the most vulnerable in society can save time too. Thus, we strive to practice what we preach and we couldn’t do it without help from some dope tools that literally give us minutes and hours that we can otherwise spend on mRelief.com.</p>

      <h3>Food Stamps For Thought: Scholarship in Human Services Delivery</h3>
      <p><i>By Rose Afriyie, Published August 31st, 2015</i></p>
      
      <p>Startup time goes fast. It feels like only yesterday we had our first prototype and now we are on the eve of September 1st, our  1-year-anniversary since we launched live on the web. As a co-founder of mRelief.com, a nonprofit dedicated to fixing the broken American welfare system that leaves vulnerable people without available public assistance, we are spending more time these days reading about the industry of social service delivery. </p>

      <h3>1 Parent’s Take: The Search For Early Learning Programs</h3>
      <p><i>By Rose Afriyie, Published August 6th, 2015</i></p>
      
      <p>Just in time for back-to-school season, we sat down with a Chicago parent to discuss early childhood programs. We talked about early learning challenges, preferences, and insights on the <%= link_to "Early Learning Finder", early_learning_url, target: "_blank" %>, that our organization mRelief tested with a parent this week.</p>

      <h3>Open Data Features Bilingual Early Learning in Chicago</h3>
      <p><i>By Rose Afriyie, Published July 20th, 2015</i></p>
      
      <p>One of the greatest currencies I have in this life has been retaining my mother tongue, Twi, a language I learned as a child from the strong women who cared for me. My parents are immigrants who spent most of my early childhood working 1 or 2 full-time jobs just to make ends meet. So when my grandmother immigrated to the US during my early childhood to raise me, she taught me both English and Twi.</p>

      <h3>Why Paper Prototypes Are Vital to Building with Communities</h3>
      <p><i>By Rose Afriyie, Published July 6th, 2015</i></p>
      
      <p>On June 1st, mRelief began the journey of our next major iteration — a universal template that would enable any program provider to create screeners for their programs on a user friendly interface. However, unlike the 5 iterations that preceded it, which involved implementing highly ranked user features from surveys and expansions to our forms which received the highest traffic, we tried something new. We were going to start our iteration without writing a single line of code — for a month.</p>
